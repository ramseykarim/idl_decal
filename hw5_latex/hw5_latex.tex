\begin{abstract}
I thought this course was a great introduction to IDL.
I thought the class was taught well and I have no suggestions.
\end{abstract}

\section{The Good}
I thought the way you guys lectured was very educational.
The notes on the board help a lot, and the live terminal demonstration
is invaluable.
The lab sessions were helpful and gave us a good opportunity to get work done.

\section{The Bad}
Honestly, not much in this course struck me as ``bad''.
If I had to make one remark, I would say that the clarity of some of the
homework and lab write ups could be scrutinized and improved (sometimes
it was hard to tell what \textit{exactly} to do next), but it was never
a huge issue.

\section{The Math}
$$ \sum^{n}_{j=0} (-1)^{j} \partial^{j}_{\mu_{1} \dots \mu{j}} \left( \frac{\partial \Lagr}{\partial f_{i,\mu_{1} \dots \mu{j}}} \right) = 0$$
The $\mu_{1} \dots \mu_{j}$ means $\mu_{1}, \mu{2}, \mu{3}, \dots$
all the way to $\mu_{j}$.

\section{The Tables}

\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{||l|r|}
\hline \\
Thing that I like to do & Why I can't do it \\\hline
Read & 111A Lab \\
Go to SF & 111A Lab \\
Eat at restaurants & No money \\
Hang out with friends & No friends \\
Have nice things & This \\\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{\label{tab:t1}This list of things is just so tight}
\end{table}
As you can see in Table \ref{tab:t1}, I exaggerate here and there,
but I \textit{can't possibly} exaggerate about 111A.

\section{The Lists}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Austin McDowell
\item Joe Zalesky
\item Will Schultz
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\item 9

You guys did good!

\section{The Figures}
We have a figure here:
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{idlfig1.PNG}
\caption{\label{fig:f1}This is the best I ever did in 2048, don't laugh at me}
\end{figure}
And as you can see from Figure \ref{fig:f1}, I never got 8192
and I am going to regret that forever.

\section{The Thank You Part}
Thank you for teaching this class!
I learned a lot and really appreciate your time and effort.
I feel very prepared for Radio Lab.
Have a good dead week/finals week/winter!
